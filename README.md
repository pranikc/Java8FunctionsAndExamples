# Java 8 Functions And Examples
Working and learning Java 8 to its full potential together!

Dear User,

This project was created to understand the benefit and usefulness of Java 8, especially its Lambda Expressions.
Lambda expressions are a new and updated style of programming practice added in Java 8. 

Because its release was so profound, in fact on me, I have now come to feel that what distinguishes a good programmer from an excellent 
one is determined by how much one uses them, especially since lambda expressions are so pristine and pure to look upon.

As result, feel free to append upon this project with new functions and lambda expressions as well as entirely new projects.
With this, you CAN help the world, including myself furthermore, learn and appreciate this new, valuable tool.

Thanks ;)

Sincerely,

Pranik Chainani
